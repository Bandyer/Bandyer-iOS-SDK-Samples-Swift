# Bandyer SDK UI Customization Example

This sample app is going to show you how the Bandyer SDK should be configured, initialized, and how you can interact with it.

This example is only related to let you customize our UI components. For other examples, please visit the [Sample apps index page](https://github.com/Bandyer/Bandyer-iOS-SDK-Samples-Swift).

## Quickstart

1. Obtain a Mobile API key.
2. Install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) .
3. In terminal, `cd` to the sample project directory you are interested in and type `pod install`.
4. Open the project in Xcode using the `.xcworkspace` file just created.
5. Replace "PUT YOUR APP ID HERE" placeholder inside `AppDelegate` class with the app id provided. 
6. Replace the app bundle identifier and set up code signing if you want to run the example on a real device.

## Caveats

This app uses fake users fetched from our backend system. We provide access to those user through a REST api which requires another set of access keys. Once obtained, replace "REST API KEY" and "REST URL" placeholders inside `UserRepository` class.

If your backend system already provides Bandyer "user alias" for your users, then you should modify the app in order to fetch users information from you backend system instead of ours.
