        //app capabilities for CallKit and VoIP notifications.

        //Namely, you must enable "Background modes" capability
        //checking "Audio, AirPlay and Picture in Picture" and "Voice over IP" checkboxes on.
        //You must also enable "Push notifications" capability even if you use VoIP notifications only.

        //Privacy usage descriptions:
        //You must add NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription to your app Info.plist file.
        //Those values are required to access microphone and camera. In this sample app, those values have been already added for you.

        //Consider also to add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key into app Info.plist in case you want your users to upload photos on our services.

        //If your build target is less than iOS 11, please add iCloud entitlement with at least Key-value storage checked,
        //otherwise your app is going to crash anytime the user try to upload a document from iCloud.
        //In this sample app, this is already done for you inside 'Signing & Capabilities' tab of project settings.

        //To enable build on physical devices, you should disable bitcode on build settings tab of your target settings. In this sample app, this flag is already set for you.

        //CallKit:
        //CallKit framework must be linked to your app and it must linked as a required framework,
        //otherwise the app will have a weird behaviour when it is launched upon receiving a VoIP notification.
        //It is going to be launched, but the system is going to suspend it after few milliseconds.
        //In this example app, the CallKit framework has been already added for you.

        //framework is linked as required framework

        //a call from the lock screen or when the app is not in foreground and a call is in progress, the system
        //presents the system call UI to the end user. One of the buttons gives the user the ability to get back into your
        //app. The following statements allows you to change that icon.

        //length 40 points square png image.
