        //checking "Audio, AirPlay and Picture in Picture" and "Voice over IP" checkboxes on.
        //You must also enable "Push notifications" capability even if you use VOIP notifications only.

        //You must add NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription to your app Info.plist file.
